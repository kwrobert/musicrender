# Introduction

This is my repo with a javascript code for rendering music notation in my
personal gitit wiki 

# Installing

Its a bit complicated to set things up. You'll need to install node. Do so with 

```
sudo apt install nodejs nodejs-legacy
```

This `nodejs-legacy` package just adds a symlink so you can run things on the
command line with `node`. 


Next, globally install the browserify command line tool for bundling node
dependencies into the main client side script

```
sudo npm install -g browserify
```
